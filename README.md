# flappy-bird
A simple clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project recreates the famous game, allowing the player to control a bird and navigate through obstacles without hitting the pipes. It's a great way to explore JavaScript and develop a basic 2D browser game.
